It does not fall under any prohibited categories in Article 5. It is not a safety component of a product covered by Annex I, nor does it require third-party conformity assessment. The system does not match any of the high-risk use cases listed in Annex III, as it is not used for biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, employment decisions, essential services access, law enforcement, migration control, or justice processes. Additionally, it does not have transparency obligations as it doesn't interact with natural persons in a way that could be confused with human interaction, generate synthetic content, recognize emotions, categorize based on biometric data, or create deep fakes.", 'Requires Additional Information': 'No'}}
