This solution is deployed in the retail sector, providing a virtual environment to test different store configurations before actual implementation. The system operates with a high level of autonomy, utilizing machine learning algorithms trained on real-world data to forecast shopper movements and interactions within the store. The primary data used includes customer flow patterns, purchase histories, and spatial layouts. The primary users are retail store designers and managers seeking to optimize store layouts for enhanced customer experience and sales performance. The AI system is adaptive, learning from new data to refine its predictions over time. While not safety-critical, the system significantly impacts business decisions and customer satisfaction by enabling data-driven store design."
