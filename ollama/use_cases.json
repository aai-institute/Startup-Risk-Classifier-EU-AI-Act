Traditionally, this task involves manually guiding a sniffer probe along metal pipes and compressors to detect coolant leaks at solder joints. The challenge lies in the variability of each refrigerator's back panel, including differences in position, color, shape, and the number of solder points. MIRAI addresses these variances by enabling robots to learn from human demonstrations. During training, employees show the system the solder points using a camera mounted on the robot arm. MIRAI then generates appropriate responses to new situations during operation, allowing robots to reliably identify all solder joints and approach them with millimeter precision, regardless of their variability.
