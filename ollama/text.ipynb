    "AI Use Case: AI-Based Analytics and Reporting - 1\n",
    "Use Case Description: aedifion employs artificial intelligence to continuously monitor and analyze building operations, identifying faults and optimization opportunities. This is deployed in the real estate sector, specifically for building management. The system operates autonomously, providing real-time insights and recommendations without manual intervention. For individuals, this means improved comfort and air quality within buildings. The AI utilizes data from building management systems, sensors, and environmental inputs. Users include facility managers, building owners, and operators. The system is adaptive, learning from ongoing data to enhance its analyses and recommendations. While not directly safety-critical, it contributes to maintaining safe and comfortable building environments.\n",
    "Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system\n",
    "Reason: Step 1: Prohibited AI System Check - This use case does not fall under any of the prohibited categories outlined in Article 5(1). It does not involve manipulation, exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, crime risk assessment, facial scraping, emotion recognition in sensitive contexts, biometric categorization of protected characteristics, or real-time remote biometric identification.\n",
    "Step 2: High-Risk AI System under Annex I Check - The system is an analytics tool for building management. While building management systems *can* be covered by Union Harmonization Laws (e.g., Machinery Directive if the building system incorporates machinery, or potentially Radio Equipment Directive for wireless sensors), the description does not indicate that the AI system *is* a safety component, nor that it requires third-party conformity assessment under those laws. It provides insights and recommendations, but does not directly control safety-critical functions.\n",
    "Step 3: High-Risk AI System under Annex III Check - The use case does not fall under any of the categories listed in Annex III. It’s not related to biometric identification/categorization, critical infrastructure, education, employment, essential services access, law enforcement, migration/asylum, or justice/democratic processes. It is an analytical tool.\n",
    "Step 4: Transparency Obligations Check - The system does not involve interacting with natural persons in a way that could be mistaken for human interaction. It does not generate synthetic content, and it does not involve emotion recognition or biometric categorization.\n",
    "Step 5: Classification - Since the system does not meet the criteria for any of the high-risk or prohibited classifications, and there are no transparency obligations, it is classified as a low-risk AI system.\n",

    "Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system  \n",
    "Reason:  \n",
    "1. **Prohibited AI system check**: None of the prohibited categories (Articles 5(1)(a)–(h)) apply. The system does not involve harmful manipulation, exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, crime risk assessment, facial scraping, emotion recognition, biometric categorization, or real-time biometric identification.  \n",
    "2. **High-risk under Annex I**: The system is not a safety component of a product covered by Union harmonization laws listed in Annex I. While it contributes to building safety indirectly, it does not fulfill a safety function or endanger health/safety if malfunctioning (per the definition of \"safety component\"). It is not listed under any of the harmonized laws (e.g., Machinery Directive, Medical Devices Regulation, etc.) as a safety-critical product or component.  \n",
    "3. **High-risk under Annex III**: The system does not fall under any of the Annex III categories (e.g., critical infrastructure, education, employment, law enforcement, etc.). It is not involved in managing critical infrastructure (e.g., water, gas, electricity) explicitly listed in Annex III(b), nor does it involve biometric data, emotion recognition, or other listed high-risk applications.  \n",
    "4. **Transparency obligations**: No transparency obligations apply. The system does not interact with natural persons in a deceptive manner (Art 50(1)), generate synthetic content (Art 50(2)), use emotion/biometric categorization (Art 50(3)), or involve deepfakes (Art 50(4)).  \n",
    "5. **Final classification**: Since it does not meet any criteria for prohibited, high-risk, or transparency obligations, it qualifies as a **Low-risk AI system**.  \n",

    "Reason: This use case does not fall under any of the prohibited conditions specified in Articles 5(1)(a) through (h). It is neither a high-risk AI system covered by Annex I nor Annex III. The system focuses on improving building operations, comfort, and air quality but does not qualify as a safety component required to undergo third-party conformity assessment according to Union harmonization laws listed in Annex I. Additionally, the use case does not involve any biometric data or emotion recognition, which would have triggered the high-risk classification under Annex III. The system's operational scope is limited to building management and does not intersect with critical infrastructure safety components nor educational/training systems that could be considered high risk. Thus, it meets none of the criteria for \"High-risk AI system\" classifications. It also lacks any requirements for transparency obligations as listed in Articles 50(1) through (4). Therefore, this AI use case is classified as a Low-risk AI system.\n",
