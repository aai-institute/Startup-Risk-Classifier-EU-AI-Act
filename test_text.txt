AI Use Case: Large Language Models (LLMs) Development

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: This general development of large language models does not fall under any of the prohibited categories in Article 5. It is not a safety component of a product covered by Union harmonization laws in Annex I, nor does it specifically align with any of the high-risk areas listed in Annex III. Without specific information about how these models will be deployed or used, they cannot be classified as high-risk. The case description doesn't indicate these models are designed for emotion recognition, biometric categorization, or specifically creating synthetic content that would trigger transparency obligations.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Decentralized AI Model Training

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: This platform for decentralized AI model training does not fall under any prohibited use cases in Article 5. It is not a safety component or product covered by Annex I legislation. The platform itself for distributed training across multiple nodes does not align with any high-risk areas in Annex III. While the platform may facilitate the training of various AI models, the platform itself and the distributed training methodology are not high-risk. There's no indication that the platform inherently has transparency obligations.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Scientific AI Model Training

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: Supporting scientists in training foundation models for scientific advancement does not fall under any prohibited categories in Article 5. It is not a safety component of products covered by Annex I, nor does the general scientific research support align with specific high-risk use cases in Annex III. Without specific information about how these scientific models would be deployed in potentially high-risk domains, the general support for scientific AI model training remains low-risk. No transparency obligations are indicated based on the information provided.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Reasoning Model Training

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: Developing and training AI models focused on reasoning tasks does not fall under any prohibited categories. These reasoning models are not safety components of products covered by Annex I. The general development of reasoning models without specific application in high-risk domains listed in Annex III keeps this in the low-risk category. There's no indication these models specifically generate synthetic content, perform emotion recognition, or other functions requiring transparency obligations.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: AI Coding Agents Development

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: AI-driven coding agents that automate software development tasks don't fall under prohibited uses in Article 5. They are not safety components of products in Annex I. While these could potentially be used in various domains, the general purpose of automating code writing, debugging, and optimization doesn't specifically align with high-risk areas in Annex III. There's no indication these coding agents inherently require transparency obligations based on the information provided.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Verifiable AI Reasoning with SYNTHETIC-1

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: The development of the SYNTHETIC-1 dataset for training reasoning models across various domains does not fall under prohibited categories in Article 5. It's not a safety component of products under Annex I. The general purpose of training models for reasoning in math, coding, and science without specific application in high-risk domains listed in Annex III keeps this as low-risk. The case description doesn't indicate transparency obligations apply.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Synthetic Data Generation with Reinforcement Learning

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: Using the Genesys framework for synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning doesn't fall under prohibited uses in Article 5. It's not a safety component of products under Annex I. The general purpose of community-driven model improvement via verified reasoning doesn't specifically align with high-risk areas in Annex III. While this case mentions synthetic data generation, there's no indication it's specifically creating synthetic content (audio, images, video, text) that would trigger transparency obligations under Article 50(2).

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Decentralized Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (INTELLECT-2)

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: The development of INTELLECT-2 for decentralized reinforcement learning doesn't fall under prohibited uses in Article 5. It's not a safety component of products under Annex I. The general purpose of training reasoning models using permissionless compute contributions doesn't specifically align with high-risk areas in Annex III. There's no indication these models inherently require transparency obligations based on the information provided.

Requires Additional Information: No

AI Use Case: Verifiable Inference with TOPLOC

Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system

Reason: The TOPLOC method for ensuring AI model integrity using locality-sensitive hashing doesn't fall under prohibited uses in Article 5. It's not a safety component of products under Annex I. This verification methodology focused on maintaining AI integrity doesn't specifically align with high-risk areas in Annex III. There's no indication this verification method inherently requires transparency obligations.
