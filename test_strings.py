AI Use Case: Total Store Simulation  
Use Case Description: 10AI employs AI to simulate in-store customer behavior, allowing retailers to predict the impact of store layout changes on overall performance. This solution is deployed in the retail sector, providing a virtual environment to test different store configurations before actual implementation. The system operates with a high level of autonomy, utilizing machine learning algorithms trained on real-world data to forecast shopper movements and interactions within the store. The primary data used includes customer flow patterns, purchase histories, and spatial layouts. The primary users are retail store designers and managers seeking to optimize store layouts for enhanced customer experience and sales performance. The AI system is adaptive, learning from new data to refine its predictions over time. While not safety-critical, the system significantly impacts business decisions and customer satisfaction by enabling data-driven store design.  
Risk Classification: Low-risk AI system  

Reason:
Step 1 – Prohibited AI System: The system does not fall under any of the Article 5 prohibitions. It does not manipulate behavior through subliminal techniques (Art. 5(1)(a)), exploit vulnerabilities due to age/disability/social situation (Art. 5(1)(b)), perform social scoring (Art. 5(1)(c)), conduct crime risk assessment based solely on profiling or traits (Art. 5(1)(d)), engage in untargeted facial image scraping (Art. 5(1)(e)), infer emotions in the education/workplace (Art. 5(1)(f)), categorize individuals based on biometric data to derive sensitive attributes (Art. 5(1)(g)), or perform real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement (Art. 5(1)(h)).

Step 2 – High-risk under Annex I: The AI system is not a safety component of a regulated product under Annex I (e.g., no medical device, machinery, vehicle, etc.). It is a simulation tool used by retailers, not covered by any Union harmonization law. Therefore, this does not apply.

Step 3 – High-risk under Annex III: The system does not fall under any of the high-risk categories in Annex III:
a) Not used for biometric identification/categorization or emotion recognition.
b) Not related to the safety of critical infrastructure.
c) Not used in education or training.
d) Not used for employment or worker management.
e) Not used for determining access to essential services like credit or emergency services.
f) Not used in law enforcement or crime prevention.
g) Not used for migration/asylum/border control.
h) Not used in the justice system or democratic processes.

Step 4 – Transparency Obligations: The system does not appear to interact directly with natural persons in a way that may cause users to mistake it for a human (Art. 50(1)), does not generate synthetic content (Art. 50(2)), and is not an emotion recognition or biometric categorization system (Art. 50(3)). It also does not create manipulated or deepfake content (Art. 50(4)).

Step 5 & 6 – Since the system does not fall under high-risk categories and does not trigger transparency obligations, this step does not apply.

Final determination: None of the risk categories are met. This system is used for business process optimization via simulation and customer behavior modeling and does not have direct societal or individual high-risk impacts as defined under the AI Act.
