AI Use Case: Total Store Simulation - Chatpgt 
Use Case Description: 10AI employs AI to simulate in-store customer behavior, allowing retailers to predict the impact of store layout changes on overall performance. This solution is deployed in the retail sector, providing a virtual environment to test different store configurations before actual implementation. The system operates with a high level of autonomy, utilizing machine learning algorithms trained on real-world data to forecast shopper movements and interactions within the store. The primary data used includes customer flow patterns, purchase histories, and spatial layouts. The primary users are retail store designers and managers seeking to optimize store layouts for enhanced customer experience and sales performance. The AI system is adaptive, learning from new data to refine its predictions over time. This is different.
Risk Classification: High-risk AI system under Annex I

Reason:
Step 1: High-risk AI system under Annex I and i dont know 
- This system does not use subliminal techniques, or purposefully manipulative/deceptive mechanisms (Art. 5(1)(a)). Its purpose is forecasting and simulation for spatial layout decisions.
- It does not exploit vulnerable groups such as children, elderly, or disadvantaged populations (Art. 5(1)(b)), but targets professionals in the retail sector.
- It does not assign social scores or provide classification based on social behavior or personal characteristics for the purpose of unrelated treatment (Art. 5(1)(c)).
- It does not assess crime risks or predict criminal behavior (Art. 5(1)(d)).
- It does not use untargeted facial image scraping, emotion recognition in workplaces/education, biometric categorization by sensitive traits, or real-time remote biometric ID for law enforcement (Art. 5(1)(e)-(h)).
⇒ Therefore, this is not a prohibited AI system.

Step 2: High-risk AI system under Annex I (Product safety laws)
- The system is not a product or safety component within the scope of Union harmonization laws such as medical device, machinery, automotive, or aviation directives.
- It is used in retail layout design, not in sectors regulated under Annex I legislation.
⇒ It does not qualify as a high-risk AI system under Annex I.

Step 3: High-risk AI system under Annex III
- It is not used for biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, employment, access to services, law enforcement, migration, or justice.

- The system analyzes customer behavior in commercial retail settings and supports store layout design.
⇒ Does not fall under any high-risk domain in Annex III.

Step 4: Transparency Obligations
- Art. 50(1): Interaction with natural persons – Not applicable; this system is used by professionals for simulation and prediction and does not directly interact with end-customers during operation.
- Art. 50(2): Synthetic content – No synthetic media generation involved such as outputting manipulated image/video/text/audio resembling real events or people.
- Art. 50(3): Emotion recognition/biometric categorization – No biometric data or emotion inference is used.
- Art. 50(4): Deepfakes – No output of deepfake content.
⇒ No transparency obligation applies.

Step 5 and Step 6: The system is neither high-risk nor has transparency obligations.

Final Step 7: Since it doesn’t fall under prohibited AI, high-risk AI under Annex I or III, and has no transparency obligations, it is therefore classified correctly as:
Low-risk AI system.
