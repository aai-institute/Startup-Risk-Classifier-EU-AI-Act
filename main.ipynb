    "AI systems with potential for manipulation or deceit, requiring transparency. General purpose AI (GPAI) models also fall under this category. ‘General-purpose AI model’ means an AI model trained on large-scale data, often using self-supervision, that exhibits broad versatility, can perform diverse tasks competently, and is integrable into various downstream systems or applications. This excludes models used solely for research, development, or prototyping prior to market placement.\n",
